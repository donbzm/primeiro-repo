No matter what scars you bear
Whatever uniform you wear
You can fight like a krogan, run like a leopard
But you'll never be better than commander shepard
You can fight like a krogan, run like a leopard
But you'll never be better than commander shepard
You can fight like a krogan, run like a leopard
But you'll never be better than commander shepard
